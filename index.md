# About me

Hello! I'm currently a PhD student at the [Institute of Neural Information Processing](https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/in/institute-of-neural-information-processing/) at Ulm University, where I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Dr. Dr. Daniel Alexander Braun](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/neuroinformatik/institut/hidden/d-braun/). My research lies at the intersection of *reinforcement learning*, *goal-conditioned learning*, *intrinsic motivation*, and *world model learning*. I'm particularly interested in how autonomous agents can learn and adapt in complex, dynamic environments driven by internal goals and curiosity. Besides, I am also interested in agent-based modeling and its applications in computational economics.

I hold a Master's degree in *Cognitive Systems*—an interdisciplinary program combining computer science and psychology—from Ulm University. Before that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in *Electronic Science and Technology* from Southeast University in China.
